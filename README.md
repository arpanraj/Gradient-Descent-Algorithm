# Gradient-Descent-Algorithm
Write a short program to execute the Gradient Descent (GD) algorithm as described in class. Recall that
the key steps in GD are as follows:

Apply GD to approximately solve for the global minimum of the function 𝑓(𝑥, 𝑦) = 5𝑥2 + 40x + 𝑦2 -12𝑦 + 127.
You will run (3) sets of experiments using different values for η: (i) η = .1, (ii) η =.01, and (iii) η =.001. Run
GD for 500 steps for each experiment;

in each case initialize 𝑥0 ∈ [−10,10] × [−10,10].
